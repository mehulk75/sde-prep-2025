# 🗓️ Daily Log – 11 May 2025 (Day 3 – Restart Day)

## ✅ Tasks Completed:

- Solved:
  - Leetcode 680 – Valid Palindrome II (Two Pointers)
  - Leetcode 56 – Merge Intervals (Sorting + Merge Logic)
- Pushed both problems to GitHub with well-commented `.cpp` files and explanations

## ❌ Tasks Missed:

- OS Concepts review (will carry over to Day 4)
- Quant prep (starting from tomorrow)

## 💡 Learnings & Notes:

- Understood how allowing at most one character removal still limits the solution space to two substrings.
- Practiced merging overlapping intervals with clean tracking of current interval.
- Realized that I can bounce back from breaks — and feel more confident again.

## 🔜 Next Steps:

- Restart core prep with OS and Quant from Day 4
- Continue DSA daily (focus on Greedy / Stack next)
- Start reading about dynamic programming patterns

## 😌 Reflection:

Bounced back after a 3-day block. Completing two good problems today felt like reclaiming control. Starting to rebuild discipline.
