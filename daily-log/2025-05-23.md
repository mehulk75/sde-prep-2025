# 🗓️ Daily Log – 23 May 2025 (Day 8)

## ✅ Tasks Completed:
- Leetcode 1155 – Number of Dice Rolls With Target Sum (DP + Combinatorics)
- Leetcode POTD – Zero Array Transformation 3 (Hard – greedy + transformation logic)
- Quant Puzzle: Probability of drawing two different-colored balls (without replacement)
- Dev Work: Started portfolio website – base setup created and repo initialized

## 🔁 Reflection:
Strong 2-hour deep work session. Solved two meaningful DSA problems — one involving complex transformation logic (POTD), the other strengthening DP + combinatorics. Portfolio base is finally in motion. Feeling dialed in again and ready to build upward from here.
