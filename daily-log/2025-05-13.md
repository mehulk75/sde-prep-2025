# 🗓️ Daily Log – 13 May 2025 (Day 5)

## ✅ Tasks Completed:

- ✅ Solved DSA problems:
  - Leetcode 20 – Valid Parentheses
  - Leetcode 739 – Daily Temperatures
  - Leetcode 84 - Largest Rectangle in Histogram
- ✅ Quant:
  - Learned Bayes’ Theorem and wrote notes
  - Solved puzzle: 3 boxes with coins (applied conditional probability)
- ✅ Project:
  - Thought about the portfoli design and finalised it
  - Initialized portfolio project using React + Vite + Tailwind CSS

## 💡 Learnings & Notes:

- Learned the power of monotonic stacks in "Daily Temperatures"
- Bayes’ Theorem felt intuitive once visualized with the coin problem
- React + Tailwind combo feels modern and clean — excited to build out my personal portfolio

## 😌 Reflection:

Felt fully aligned today — covered problem solving, quant thinking, and actual development. Seeing progress across all fronts gives clarity and motivation.

## 🔜 Next Step:

- Add content and responsiveness to portfolio (About + Projects sections)
- Begin AlgoVisualizer project setup
- Move toward DP in DSA and expected value in Quant
