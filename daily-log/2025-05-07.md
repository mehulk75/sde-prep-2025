# 🗓️ Daily Log – 07 May 2025 (Day 2)

## ✅ Tasks Completed:

- [x] Solved DSA problems using Sliding Window:
  - LeetCode 3 – Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
  - LeetCode 76 – Minimum Window Substring

## ❌ Tasks Not Completed:

- Operating System topic: Process vs Thread, Scheduling Algorithms
- Resume SDE tweaking (Spinny bullet points)
- Push verification and cleanup
- Updating main repo README

## 💡 Learnings & Notes:

- Sliding window is powerful when window boundaries can grow and shrink dynamically.
- Hashmap-based character frequency control is key in substring problems.
- Leetcode 76 was challenging but clarified the concept of **valid window tracking**.

## 🔜 Next Steps:

- Watch a short video on OS processes and threads.
- Finalize GitHub commit + daily log push.
- Prepare for DSA questions around two pointers / prefix sums tomorrow.
