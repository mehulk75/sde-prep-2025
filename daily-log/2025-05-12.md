# 🗓️ Daily Log – 12 May 2025 (Day 4)

## ✅ Tasks Completed:
- ✅ Solved Leetcode 134 – Gas Station (Greedy)
- ✅ Solved Quant Puzzle – "100 coins, split into two piles with equal heads"
- ✅ Read and noted basics of Probability (P(A), P(A ∩ B), conditional probability)
- ✅ Created `quant/probability/notes.md` with key formulas

## 💡 Learnings & Notes:
- Understood greedy application for circular conditions in Gas Station problem.
- Practiced logical splitting in puzzles — interesting insight: flipping unknowns balances heads.
- Refreshed conditional probability and permutations through GFG and practice notes.

## 😌 Reflection:
Felt focused and efficient. Managed to maintain all three tracks (DSA, Quant, and Theory).  
Probability seems vast, but with today’s structure, it feels more doable and less overwhelming.

## 🔜 Next Step:
- Learn Bayes’ Theorem and Expected Value
- Continue DSA (focus: Stack or DP)
- Watch the OS scheduling video
