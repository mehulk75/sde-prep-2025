# 🗓️ Daily Log – 15 May 2025 (Day 7)

## ✅ Tasks Completed:
- ✅ Leetcode 155 – Min Stack
- ✅ Leetcode 853 – Car Fleet
- ✅ Quant:
  - Solved a real-world Bayes' Theorem problem (disease test accuracy)
  - Updated notes with conditional probability examples

## ❌ Tasks Missed:
- Portfolio styling and project card integration
- AlgoVisualizer bubble sort setup

## 💡 Learnings & Notes:
- Understood how stacks are used for tracking min/max state efficiently
- Simulation logic in Car Fleet felt tricky but rewarding
- Got a clearer grasp on why rare-event probabilities behave counterintuitively (Bayes' application)

## 😌 Reflection:
Maintained consistency on core prep even with a tighter schedule. Will catch up on portfolio/dev side tomorrow.

## 🔜 Next Step:
- Style About + Projects sections on portfolio
- Kick off Bubble Sort logic in AlgoVisualizer
