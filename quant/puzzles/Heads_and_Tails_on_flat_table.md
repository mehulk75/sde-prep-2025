Puzzle:
You have 100 coins lying flat on a table. 10 are heads up, and 90 are tails up. You canâ€™t see or feel which side is up. Split the coins into two piles such that each pile has the same number of heads.

Solution:
We will try to split the coins in the numbers 10 and 90 (i.e. the numbers of head we have) so that the number of tails in 10 coins group == number of heads in another group.
If we flip the 10 coins the number of heads will be same in both the groups
